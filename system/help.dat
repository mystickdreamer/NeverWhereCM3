Where as a swords blade is made to be balanced and agile, the 
axes focus more on hitting harder with a sharp blade.
The means of damaging your opponent is hacking away at them. 
In this sense there is much less finesse in your attack. 
Many variationshave been made on axes, including lengthening 
the pole, adding a second blade, adding massive weight, making 
them light enough to throw, etc..

&GCheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur (destruction of

What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using gold that was accidentally duplicated
 - doing something an imm told you specifically not to do
 
Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above. 
 
If you find you have accidentally duplicated an item, turn the item over

Name     effectivity~
Text     Talent levels are dictated by three scales: Skill, Power, and Effectivity.
 
Your Skill in a telent is simply how many high you have Leveled that
Talent.  Anyone can level any talent to 200.
 
Without Power, however, Skill is useless.  Power is how much you have
traded in for a Talent.  This requires tradein points (tps).
 
Skill and Power combine to determine your Effectivity, which is your
refined strength.  Effectivity (Eff) regulates how strong your 
character's magic is.  While Skill does determine which spells and
abilities you have access to, certain spells and abilities require a
high Eff to use (for example, 100 motion Skill will not give you Bypass
Notravel; only if you have 100 Effectivity).

Name     experience~
Text     Talent levels and Weapon skills are based on experience.  If you are level 1
in Time, it will take very little experience to get you to level 2.  In fact,
casting one Time spell will probably raise your level.  When you get to higher
levels, it will take considerably more experience.  Weapon skills work the
same way.  If you are level 0 in claws, and you claw someone, your claws skill
will probably go up.  When it gets to higher levels, it will take much more
to raise it.  The most common way of gaining experience is by exploring,
although you do get some exp when you fight something.
 
When first starting out, it is recommended that you gain your experience
from exploring the areas around you and moving from one place to the next.
In order to use this earned experience, try targetting yourself with some
of your abilities. To see these, type SLIST. Don't worry, even your 
offencive capabilities are not dangerous to yourself at this point, so feel
free to target them on to yourself. This is especially true of your inborn
talent.
 
Your experience is not shown, but the MUD keeps track of it.  You must simply 
estimate how close you are to gaining a level.  If you type "attributes" you
can see a verbal indicator of your exp pool.  If you are bored, you should go 
explore or fight to gain more.  If you are "brimming with inspiration" you
should have no trouble leveling when you use your skills.

Your exp goes into a large pool, and when you use skills or abilities they take
out exp and use it.  Since you gain exp by fighting or walking, quite often
your skills use up exp as fast as you can gain it.
 
If you have trouble, do not hesitate to ask for assistance from fellow players.
There is almost always someone willing to help.

Name     gargoyles~
Text     Gargoyles were originally sculpted of stone to guard a variety of medieval
cathedrals, but at night strong magicks worked on the gargoyles, letting
them take to the skies as if they had always been truly living beings.
But they always had to return to their perch and return to stone again at
dawn, for they would turn into statues once again, and be frozen in place
until the sun sets again.  Gargoyles are almost alive, yet not quite
entirely, having some remnant left of their stoney origins.

Gnomes usually focus in the magical or clerical arts, though a few
rogues have ventured into the arts of thieving (albeit often not
very well.)

Gnomes are a short, stocky race, similar to their dwarven cousins.

or mana back if you are starving or dehydrated.

Any time you feel you have been harassed, You must do the following:

By just typing 'memorize' you will begin to memorize the room you
are in as your recall location. It should take a few seconds to
complete. If you want to cancel the memorization, simply enter any
other command and it will stop.
 
Mages with the recall command, or similar, may use 'memorize <number>'
to fill the other 7 slots with memorized places. Any character may
memorize rooms in these slots too, but will not be able to use them
without the appropriate motion talent level.
 
After level 30 in the motion talent, you will be able to add one more slot as
a recall point. This next slot that can be used will become available
to you after every 10 levels in motion occurs. 
&RIE&W: Level 40 motion mage has just reached that level.
That mage will have two extra slots to recall to, letting them use up to
slot 2, as well as the slot 0 of default recall that everyone gets.

Name     mentalstate~
Text     Your mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by spells, mana burn, mana exhaustion, or poison.  If you are affected 
by one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin 
to deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly 
are.  You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, 
and your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may 
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.
 
To restore your mental state, you may need to relax (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.  If you
feel lethargic, you may want to make sure your mana is not negative and,
if it is, TAP for more mana.
 
Your mental state is by the text line in 'score' which describes your state
of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less accurate
reading of your and your group-mates' mentalstates as well.

Name     magic~

Type indicates not only what talent is being used, but what type of
magic from that talent. Some talents may have multiple types. For
example, Earth Magic involves both nature spells and rock spells, and
different types will be used to make use of each. Each type may have
several different words to indicate it. 
 
Verb and power are interchangable, and any field may be left out to
assume a default. Some verbs automatically assume a specific talent,
and vice versa. Each verb may have several different words to indicate it.
 
Power indicates how much mana will be used on the spell. More power
power will do more damage, heal more hp, and some effects require high power
to be successful. 
 
Target may be a character, an object, or none. Effects will often vary 
greatly depending on the target. A combo might do one thing when used upon
an object, but a rather different effect when used with no target. 
The default verb is tricks. This will also be used whenever a spell fails
for many reasons. Tricks will train the talent, and display a message to
that can be useful for RP, but will have no other effect.

Text     (3/1) The mud has moved!  We've done so to take care of some nasty problems 
with terrabox periodically corrupting pfiles, long bouts of downtime, and just 
general unfunness.  You may notice that your pfile isn't up to date, or may 
even be missing -- if this is the case, understand that it was nearly 
impossible to backup anything from terrabox.  If your losses are severe 
(several months old) a reimbursement might be arranged.  Also, the 
staff knows that your houses are missing. The house area file was just too
huge and unwieldy. Don't worry, though, there will be a new alternative soon.
We're sure you'll like this :)
Post on the board any levels or equipment you might have missing, really... 
if it's important and not recent stuff that happened.  Keolah wasn't able
to upload all area files or pfiles because she has a ftp quota on this new 
server.  She also complains that she wasn't able to compile her code on 
Terrabox, either, because Terrabox was being lame and shit.

Text     Orcs are a race of evil, often thought of as filthy and disgusting by
humans and elves. Dull of wit, with short yet strong bodies, they tend

goblins.  There are many warriors and archers among the orcish race,
as well as many powerful shamans.  However, their fierce warrior society
is little understood by outsiders, for the orcs carry a peculiar honor

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is

is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.

travel to them repeatedly and kill them)
If the person attacks you and runs away repeatedly, they forfeit this right,

Name     roleplay_tips~

Roleplay in public areas of the mud should be open to any and all that wish to 
join in. Mudsex in public areas will not be tolerated and tp deductions will
ensue for any offenses after the first. 
 
When using emotes, they should be open-ended, allowing other characters to
react instead of predetermining that character's action. For
example, if your character throws something at someone using a typed out emote,
don't automatically determine that it hits said character.
 
Information gathered OOCly is not known by your character, unless they have
gathered it through rp.
 
Though elkandu do not die permanently, if your character has been killed 
through rp, especially repeatedly, a rename may be appropriate.
 
When rping or in a public area, use the command osay for room ooc comments.
Repeated use of the say command for ooc comments will result in tp deductions.
 
Don't forget to report your rp using the appropriate command.
 
No actions permanently affecting another character permanently cannot be 
done without getting the approval of that character's player (This 
includes roleplayed pkilling.).
 
Actual pkilling is allowed only on the plane of Mezulbryst, no consent is 
necessary in this world. PK outside of this area will be dealt with.

Most importantly, HAVE FUN!

#HELP
Name     spells~
Text     The magic system of Rogue Winds is based on TALENTS, specific disciplines
of magic.  Each talent has its own set of spells and abilities.  Although,
there is some overlap.

Your ability in a talent is measured by three variables: SKILL, POWER, and 
EFFECTIVITY.  You start the game with talent points which can be allocated 
as you see fit.  "Trading-in" talent points causes your POWER to increase.  
When you level, your skill increases.  EFFECTIVITY is calculated from comb-
ining both SKILL and POWER in that talent.  To see these variables you can 
look into any reflecting pool.  
    &G(RP TIP: The exact values of your SKILL, POWER, and EFFECTIVITY are 
    unknown 'in character'.  You should remember this before you start 
    talking about your levels; Levels DO NOT EXIST 'in character'.)&w

New spells and abilities are gained as you advance in SKILL, but the strength 

of your spells and abilities is determined by POWER (and your stats).
You may gain more talent points later from roleplaying, bug reports, or

quests, which can be used to increase the power in your talents, or to
"discover" new talents within yourself.

You must go to a cleric to practice your spells (listed under "practice").

Name     strategy~
Text     As a newbie here, you have many choices.  You can begin playing the game,

To begin managing your character you should choose your talents.  It is
suggested you choose talents which match both your character's race and
its roleplay, though race is less of an issue.  (see also help &Ytalents&w)
 
After choosing talents, you can level them by gaining exp and using your
abilities gained through the talents you have.  You should visit the forest
west of the Nexus and through the portal to Lezaria.  Here you can simply 
explore for exp, or you can kill the furry woodland creatures.  You should
pay very good attention to the names of mobs.  'Baby' squirrels are wimps 
compared to 'large' squirrels.  'Ancient' dragons are much tougher than 
'baby' dragons.  This adjective system replaces "consider".

It is very important that you prepare yourself when you go to fight anyone.

Armor is not important in Rogue Winds.  Certain races do not use armor at 
all.  Humanoid races do benefit from the protective ability of clothing.

also fashion your own clothing from raw materials readily available from 
the mud.  (see also help &Yfashion&w)

and a long whip-like tail. They are more intelligent than regular wyverns,
and focus more on spells than combat. On the inverse of being so magical,
star wyverns tend to be weak physically, and have more frail bodies.
In the wild, they live in hidden nests high in the skies, and generally
do not venture far from their airborn living quarters. They are highly
agressive creatures and will attack anyone whom they percieve to be a threat.
Though they have not developed complete speech, they can communicate through
emitting odors from their scales. By using this, they can strike down a foe
in large groups by emitting a scent that alerts others nearby. Their name
came from the magician who created them. "Born of the sky and holding the
searing scales of fire from the heavens, they are beings destined to
conquer the stars."

would otherwise be successful. This chance is doubled if two shields
are used. Also, note that shields are held in the hands, not worn, and
so are equipped using the HOLD or WIELD command, and removed with
UNWIELD.

of rising into the skies carried up by only their own winds
The wind command allows a wind mage to bring a strong gust of wind,
damaging their opponants. This will not work underwater, for obvious reasons.

Name     zhavir~
Text     The Zhavir are from a remote world they call Nona. It is as yet
unexplored by any Elkandu. They are completely hairless and their
skin is a dull metallic hue, ranging from silvery, gold, bronze, or
copper. Most of the population is made up of sterile females (neuters)
however. The few who are born fertile male or female are kept in
safe places, strongholds, palaces, etc. The neuters do all the work,
farm crops, build buildings, and such. They rarely go far from their
homes however. Their eyes are faceted like gemstones, any color generally,
and have no whites or irises. A popular profession in the Zhavi society
is war. Warriors wear no armor into combat, as their skin has natural
defense. Because of sweat and the way they tone their muscles, their
skin shines like polished metal. A small percentage of the Zhavi
population is born with magic, generally the same type of magic for the
clan they live in. They see this magic as a "gift" however, and are
trained in all traditional uses of their clan's gift. Those who are
not born with the specific magics inherent to the clan are often
overlooked as ungifted.
